returnType name(){
//body
return statement ;
}


// function inside class is called method they both are same and also fucntion are supposed to be written only in class since it is well mannered and in c++ function can be written outside class as well..

* syntax for parameters function

returnType name(type param1 , type param2){
    //body       --------INPUT--------
    return statement ; 
}


//alag alag parameters me variable name same hoge lekin they can perform different fucntions 
//in parameters we have to give input to the function 


factorial can only be used for positive number and not for negative numbers
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ........ 1 

eg = 4! : 4 * 3 * 2 * 1


* function overloading 
multiple function with same name but different parameters

- type of parameters may be changed such as (int , float , double , long etc...)
- number of parameters may be different such as (int a , int b) or (int a , int b , int c )
- function overloading depends only on parameters not on returnType
